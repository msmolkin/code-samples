# code-samples
A few coding samples taken from various private repos.

I always had my code private, but more people want to see it, and there's only one way to scale: publicize it.

Notes:
* Code in this repository is not for reproduction without prior written permission.
* You probably don't want to use it, anyway. A lot of this code was designed to work, not to be the most elegant, beautiful thing you've ever seen.
* On the flip side, if I wrote it, chances are it does work, whether or not it's complete(ly automated).
